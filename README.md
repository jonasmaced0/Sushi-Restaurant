# Sushi-Restaurant
Project responsive of a website from a restaurant sushi in HTML, CSS and JS.

So far, this was the project where I learned the most html, css and js, it was a very long project, in which I developed in a small course a fully responsive website for a restaurant, with many interactions with javascript, from the inclusion From the dark theme, the image transitions, the interactive menus, as well as digging into the slightly more advanced CSS properties, it was really a really cool project to develop and learn.
